The staff were really nice and attentive throughout the evening too.\n\nWe'd popped in earlier in the day for a coffee and cake, with the coffee being rated as 'the best coffee I've had since we left home' (which was a month and quite a few coffees ago), plus the cake portion was huge!\n\nPS: There's a couple of sister restaurants nearby (ish). One is called 'Reform Kafé', which is an outdoor version inside the old city walls that has mostly the same menu (just no pizza's I think) but they do have beers etc, unlike Goodsouls. The other is 'Downtown Vegan Garden Restaurant', which is outside the old city walls to the East and appears to also have a similar menu and beers, cocktails etc.\n\nUpdate Sun 29 Oct 23: Our second visit was not the same at all, sadly. The service was good but food was below average. The pizza was bland and the Philly cheese steak was, despite having a generous filling, surprisingly average.

The mushroom calzone was ok but became much better when the side marinara sauce was added. I’m also a bit partial to real cheese, so I think some stretchy Mozerella—which isn’t vegan—would have made it perfect. For dessert, I got the granola and the ginger balls.

Went there at lunchtime and already struggled with ordering our drinks because the waitress didn't understand even though we showed her exactly (with fingers on the menu). She came twice to ask again and came off a bit rude, no smile at all. We ordered the Beetroot Burger and the Falafel in Pita Bread, but I got the Mushroom Burger instead.. The food was okay, the sauce on the burger was a bit salty and we didn't feel too happy afterwards. Drinking water is for free which is nice and they had lots of raw cakes which looked good, but we didn't try because we didn't feel very welcomed and comfortable.

Lots a cakes at counter when you walk in. Good dinner music playing. Nice lighting comfortable temperature. You should know that when going to such a place in Thailand your paying a premium for this. Only foreigners here. No locals. Prices are 120 bhat up. I ordered the beetroot steak for 170 bhat. What I got was nicely presented. But essentially two hamburger patties, made with beetroots. It was pretty bland and even smothered in the white country gravy didn't add much flavor. I enjoyed the steak fries. But for the price I think there could of been more. So not to be too down on the place. But for the price I'd head to reform kafe, or vegan heaven.

The setting is really nice with an indoor, air conditioned area and outdoor. The food is a bit all over the place - some dishes are excellent and some inedible. The quinoa salad was incredibly disappointing with very little quinoa that was soggy, and every flavor was acidic. The fried spring rolls are excellent. A lot of dishes are just ok. The green curry is the worst I’ve ever had - very slimey. The staff are totally indifferent every time, perhaps my biggest turn-off. The oldest waitress seems to intimidate the others. She didn’t want me to sit at a booth, she didn’t come to take my order and looked so displeased and busy when I gently asked her to take my order about 10 minutes after looking at the menu. I had to ask for water even though everyone else got it, another sneer. No matter how much I smiled, she wouldn’t smile back. Odd. Maybe she’s having a bad day but she doesn’t seem appropriate for front of house service. A little smile and some genuine service would make everything else ok.

{"review": "OKAY LISTEN UP.\nVegan food is THE most TASTY & FLAVORFUL food out there. I just went to a vegan restaurant in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I ordered a “philly cheese steak” sandwich and may have shed a tear or two as I sank my teeth into this hand crafted, mushroom stir fried beer battered delight. I couldn’t tell the difference between this vegan cheese or any other cheese I’ve eaten here. The sandwich was huge and totally affordable. It was toasted & juicy with herbs & spices that could send a smell signal to space.\n\nPlus - there needs to be a HUGE sign that tells people the following. “French fries are vegan. Salsa is vegan. Guacamole is vegan. Go vegan”\n\nBecause I left that restaurant feeling full, satisfied & content knowing that my meal was cruelty free and locally produced. Heck- I’m pretty sure I skipped to the car out of pure delight.\n\nVegan food is perfect in every way 😍\n\nBest beetroot burger , great drinks, delicious desserts! Wether you’re looking for lunch, going on a date or just want some tea - this is the best place.", "rating": 5, "source": "Google", "timestamp": "5 anni fa", "language": "en"}

It took a long time until someone came to get our orders.\nThe smoothie bowl was really really good, though, but we wouldn’t come back for it, especially because the place is pretty noisy.\nWe love the reform cafe - even though the menu is similar, the food is way better and the staff very friendly and attentive.", "rating": 2, "source": "Google", "timestamp": "8 mesi fa", "language": "en"}
