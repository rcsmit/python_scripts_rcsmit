It was a tasty and healthful option because the fresh, creamy avocado complemented the other components nicely. We also sampled the poke, which was very good. The food's flavor balance, inventive presentation, and freshness were all excellent.Our trip was further improved by the staff's attentiveness and compassion.

{"review": "Nice coffee (even if they don't offer 'normal milk').\n\nI sat down in an entirely empty area outside, got my tablet out and my coffee arrived\nThe waiter then pointed out a tiny sign on the corner of the table saying 'no laptops'.\n\nHe wouldn't budge on this. There was no-one outside! This of course annoyed me as the coffee wasn't cheap at 100thb. So he poured it into a takeaway cup and I was sent on my way.\n\nUtterly ridiculous. Especially as there were people inside using their phones.\n\nIf it's supposed to be a 'zen space' then make that clear and ban phones too.\n\nI pointed this out and the girl did apologise and said she'd make an exemption this time but I'd packed everything back up by then and felt very unwelcome and my morning was upset.\n\nSo, if you're on your own, I go up the road.\n\nAs I say - the coffee is nice though.", "rating": 1, "source": "Google", "timestamp": "4 mesi fa", "language": "en"}
