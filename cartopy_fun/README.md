## Credits
* Higly inspired by [@pythonmaps](https://github.com/pythonmaps) at twitter
* This article started as the first starting point to make an heatmap https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/custom-strava-heatmap-231267dcd084
* This comment helped me enormously to make the second heatmap https://stackoverflow.com/a/44952031/4173718

* It took me a lot of time to install cartopy and it kept asking for dependencies like Proj 4.9.0. Finally I used a file from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cartopy after help from [@GregLucas](https://github.com/greglucas) at https://gitter.im/SciTools/cartopy
